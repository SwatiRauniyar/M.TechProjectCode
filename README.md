My modified algorithm to reduce time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n logn) for Contour extraction
TestShapeHull contain code of O(n logn).
Simplify contain my new algorithm, which takes mean of horizontal x value with in a parameter and replaces these points by its new mean.
It's my new method of reducing noise in input points.
